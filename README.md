# Projeto_IIA

An university project made for a Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class.
It consists of a bot that was built to play the "Breakthrough" game. 

- This bot uses the alpha-beta pruning algorithm. The algorithm had been already implemented. The focus of the project was in evaluating each position as perfectly as possible, as well as mantaining the bot capable of delivering certain performance standards.
